This prevents unusually long requests from occupying server resources and impairing the performance of other requests.             Enable Per Application Settings        When checked, per application settings are enabled server-wide.If unchecked, per app settings are disabled server-wide.              Use UUID for cftoken          Configures ColdFusion to use a UUID rather than a random number for client and session variable cftoken values. A UUID guarantees a unique identifier for the token.                   Enable HTTP status codes          Enables ColdFusion to set HTTP error status codes when ColdFusion errors are returned to the browser. ColdFusion sets an error status code of 404 if the template is not found and an error status code of 500 for server errors.

Disable CFC Type Check         When checked, UDF arguments of CFC type is not validated. The arguments are treated as type \"ANY\".Use this setting in a production environment only.                Disable access to internal ColdFusion Java components          Disables the ability for CFML code to access and create Java objects that are part of the internal ColdFusion implementation. This prevents an unauthenticated CFML template from reading or modifying administration and configuration information for this server.              Preserve case for Struct keys for Serialization.             Maintains and preserves the case in which keys of a struct have been defined. If not checked keys     will be converted to uppercase.               Prefix serialized JSON with           Protects web services which return JSON data from cross-site scripting attacks by prefixing serialized JSON strings with a custom prefix.                 Maximum Output Buffer size   KB          Maximum output buffer size for each request in KB. If the output size for any request exceeds this limit, it would automatically get flushed. Under such circumstances the response cannot be cached.              Enable In-Memory File System          Enables the In-Memory File System support             Memory Limit for In-Memory Virtual File System     MB          Specify memory limit in MB for In-Memory Virtual File System.                 Memory Limit per Application for In-Memory Virtual File System     MB          Specify per application memory limit in MB for In-Memory Virtual File System.            Check configuration files for changes every      sec           Causes ColdFusion to watch its configuration files and automatically reload them if they change. This is required if you deploy ColdFusion in a Websphere ND vertical cluster, as multiple instances of ColdFusion share the same configuration files. Most installations should not enable this feature.              Enable Global Script Protection          Specify whether to protect Form, URL, CGI, and Cookie scope variables from cross-site scripting attacks.                  Allow Extra Attributes in AttributeCollection          Specify whether ColdFusion tags can pass non-standard attributes in the attributecollection structure.              Disable creation of unnamed applications           Do not allow creation of applications when no application name is specified in Application.cfm or Application.cfc              Allow adding application variables to Servlet Context           Specify if application variables should be added to Servlet Context. If disabled, only unnamed Application data will be added for JSP/Servlet interoperability.              ORM Search Index Directory                 Specify the absolute path to store index files for ORM search.

Google Map API Key            Specify Google Map API license key.                       Component with onServerStart( ) method             Specify the absolute path to a CFC having onServerStart() method, like \"c:\\server.cfc\". Or specify a dot delimited CFC path under webroot, like \"a.b.server\". By default, ColdFusion will look for server.cfc under webroot.               Enable Null Support          Specify if ColdFusion should enable null support. This will mean that null will not be converted to empty strings.                       Use Java As Regex Engine         Specify if the default Java RegEx engine should be used for processing the regular expressions. If not selected, Perl-compatible engine will be used. Changing the regex engine might require recompiling the coldfusion templates.        Default Maximum Thread Count For Parallel Functions     Specify the default maximum number of threads to be used for parallel functions. ColdFusion functions having parallel support use this value as a default when maxThreads argument is not specified.       Allowed file extensions for CFInclude tag        Specify the file extensions as a comma separated list which gets compiled when used in the CFInclude tag.    Blocked file extensions for CFFile uploads         Specify the file extensions as a comma-separated list, which gets blocked during file uploads using CFFile tag.  * (Wildcard) denotes to block all file uploads and :no-extension denotes to block uploads of files having no file extension.      Content Security Policy Nonce     If enabled, the Content-Security-Policy header will be sent along with a random generated nonce.          Application.cfc/Application.cfm lookup order                    Default order           Until webroot           In webroot           Specify the option ColdFusion should use to search for an Application.cfc/Application.cfm if it is not found in the current folder. By default, ColdFusion will search until the system root.         Executor Pool Configuration (Async Framework)               Core Pool Size     Core pool size is the minimum number of worker threads to keep alive.     Maximum Pool Size     Maximum number of threads that can ever be available in the pool.       Keep Alive Time     MilliSeconds  Timeout in milliseconds for idle threads waiting for work. Threads use this timeout when there are more threads than Core Pool Size present in the pool.            Cloud Services Thread Pool Configuration              Core Pool Size     Core pool size is the minimum number of worker threads to keep alive.     Maximum Pool Size     Maximum number of threads that can ever be available in the pool.       Keep Alive Time     MilliSeconds  Timeout in milliseconds for idle threads waiting for work. Threads use this timeout when there are more threads than Core Pool Size present in the pool.            Error Handlers            Missing Template Handler       Specify the relative path to the template to execute when ColdFusion cannot find a requested template.        Site-wide Error Handler       Specify the relative path to a template to execute when ColdFusion encounters errors while processing a request.            ZIP File Settings            Max Unzip Ratio     When using CFZIP to unzip a file, a ratio of 5 would mean that the maximum permissible uncompressed size of files would be 5 times the uncompressed ZIP file. The unzip action will be stopped if the ratio is reached, or the maximum file size limit is reached.              Request Size Limits              Maximum number of POST request parameters     Maximum number of parameters in a POST request sent to the server. ColdFusion rejects requests if the POST parameters exceed the limit you specify.     Maximum size of post data     MB  Limits the amount of data that can be posted to the server in a single request. ColdFusion rejects requests larger than the specified limit.       Request Throttle Threshold     MB   Requests smaller than the specified limit are not handled by the throttle.     Request Throttle Memory     MB   Limits total memory size for the throttle. ColdFusion queues requests if there is not enough total memory available. Any request larger than this limit will not be processed.            API Manager           Allow REST Discovery     Specify whether to allow API Manager to discover REST services published in ColdFusion.                         © 1995 - 2025 Adobe.

Use this setting to increase overall system performance for heavy load applications. Requests beyond the specified limit are queued.     Maximum number of simultaneous Web Service requests       The number of Web Service requests that can be processed concurrently.       Maximum number of simultaneous CFC function requests       The number of ColdFusion Component methods that can be processed concurrently via HTTP. This does not affect invocation of CFC methods from within CFML, only methods requested via an HTTP request.             Tag Limit Settings          Maximum number of simultaneous Report threads        The maximum number of ColdFusion reports that can be processed concurrently.     Maximum number of threads available for CFTHREAD           The maximum number of threads created by CFTHREAD that will be run concurrently. Threads created by CFTHREAD in excess of this are queued. For this change to take effect, you must restart the ColdFusion Server.            Queue Timeout Settings            Timeout requests waiting in queue after   seconds      If a request has waited in the queue for this long, timeout the request. This value should be at least as long as the Request Timeout setting (currently 60 seconds).         Request Queue Timeout Page       Specify a relative path from the web root to an HTML page to send to clients when a template request times out before running,for example /CFIDE/timeout.html. The page you specify cannot contain CFML.If you do not specify a page, clients receive a 500 Request Timeout error when their request does not run.                      © 1995 - 2025 Adobe.

If the cache is set to a small value, ColdFusion might re-process your templates. If your server has a sufficient amount of memory, you can achieve optimum performance by setting this value to the total number of all of your ColdFusion templates. Setting the cache to a high value does not automatically reduce available memory because ColdFusion caches templates incrementally.         Server wide cache engine             Default server wide caching engine to be used.  Switching cache engine will result in loss of old cached data.

For sites where templates are not updated during the life of the server, this minimizes file system overhead. This setting does not require restarting the server.              Cache template in request            When checked, any requested files will be inspected only once for potential updates within a request. If unchecked,   requested file will be inspected for changes each and everytime when its accessed within the same request. For application where   templates/components are not expected to reflect updates within the same request, this minimizes file system overhead. This setting does not require restarting the server.              Component cache          When checked, component path resolution is cached and not resolved again. This setting does not require restarting the server.                      Save class files          When you select this option, the class files generated by ColdFusion are saved to disk for reuse after the server restarts. Adobe recommends this for production systems.  During development, Adobe recommends that you do not select this option.               Cache web server paths          Caches page paths on embedded & multiple site web server installations, which provides improved performance.               Use internal cache to store queries          When checked, a server level internal cache is used to store cached queries. By default, cached queries are stored in QUERY region supported by currently selected caching engine at server level. You must restart the server for this change to take effect           Maximum number of cached queries     Limits the maximum number of cached queries that the server will maintain. Cached queries allow for retrieval of result sets from memory rather than through a database transaction. Since the queries reside in memory, and query result set sizes differ, there must be some user-imposed limit to the number of queries that are cached. When this value is exceeded, the oldest query is dropped from the cache and is replaced with the specified query. This setting does not apply to Application-specific caching.      Click the button below to clear the template cache. ColdFusion will reload templates into memory the next time they are requested and recompile them if they have been modified.    Clear folder specific template cache  Click Clear Template Cache of Specific Folder to clear the template cache of the selected folder. ColdFusion reloads templates into the memory, next time they are requested and recompiles them if they have been modified.          Select folder                                                Click the button to clear the component cache. ColdFusion will ignore the resolved path for components and try the resolution again.

If you specify a path that starts with the mapping's logical path in these tags, ColdFusion looks for the page using the mapping's directory path.  ColdFusion also uses mappings to find ColdFusion components (CFCs). The cfinvoke and cfobject tags and CreateObject function look for CFCs in the mapped directories.   Note:   These mappings are independent of web server virtual directories.  If you would like to create a virtual directory to access a given directory through a URL, please consult your web server documentation.

In memory caching is faster, but more memory intensive.      Maximum number of cached images       Specifies the maximum number of charts to store in the cache.  When the cache is full and a new chart is generated, the oldest chart in the cache is discarded. Caching charts results in multiple requests for the same chart being much faster, because the chart is generated only once.        Time-to-Live of each chart in seconds       Specifies the time in seconds after which the generated chart will be deleted from local disk. This can be used to prevent the expiring of chart images when there are many charts being generated in a single request.

You can control settings like what classpaths are used and how memory is allocated as well as add custom command line arguments.  Changing these settings requires restarting ColdFusion.  If you enter an incorrect setting, ColdFusion may not restart properly.  When you select the Submit button, backups of the jvm.config file are created. These backups can be used to restore the file in case of significant changes.  You can locate the jvm.config file at /Applications/ColdFusion2025/cfusion/bin/jvm.config      Java Virtual Machine Path         Specifies the location of the Java Virtual Machine.

These services can pass eventsfrom external sources to ColdFusion components that you specify. Changing thissetting starts or stops the services immediately.             Event Gateway Processing Threads           Specifies the maximum number of threads used to execute ColdFusion functionswhen an event arrives. A higher number uses more resources, but increases event throughput. On Standard or Developer Edition, this value can not exceed 1.              Maximum number of events to queue           Specifies the maximum number of events that are allowed in the event queue.If the queue length exceeds this value, gateway events are not added to theprocessing queue. This is a global setting for all event gateways. On Developer Edition, this value can not exceed 10.        SMS Test Server     To assist with the testing of SMS gateway applications, ColdFusion has a built-in SMS test server that works in conjunction with the preconfigured SMS test gateway.  After you  start the SMS test server, you can enable the SMS test gateway and use the SMS test client to test your applications.   The test server is currently stopped.                                             © 1995 - 2025 Adobe.

A sandbox is a designated area (files or directories) of your site to which you apply security restrictions. By default, a subdirectory (or child directory) inherits the sandbox settings of the directory one level above it (the parent directory). If you define sandbox settings for a subdirectory, you override the sandbox settings inherited from the parent directory.       Note:   You can configure these settings prior to enabling them on the server. Also, you must restart the ColdFusion application server to enable this setting.
